# Airliner-Sound-Effects-Addon

This addon will add immersion sounds to all Boeing 737s, add alarms to all Boeing and Airbus airliners except for the A220 (since the A220 was originally a Bombardier plane), and maybe also add different front and back sounds for the Concorde.

PLEASE NOTE: This addon is not complete, is not in active development at the time of this edit, and (as far as I know) breaks the respawn and TP system when used.
