# Airliner-Sound-Effects-Addon

NOTE: THIS ADDON IS NOT YET COMPLETE. UPDATES ARE COMING RELATIVELY SOON.

This is essentially a "run-and-forget" addon. You run the addon and essentially forget about it, and whenever you are using any 737 in GeoFS, it will have AriakimTaiyo's custom sound effects originally for the 737-700. It's a wonderful addon, and it'll get more wonderful through the month, as I add alarm and engine sound effects for the A320 family, all the other Boeing aircraft, the Boeing 777 revamp, and even dynamic Concorde sounds.

Please note: if you run the addon while in a non-737, it will fill the console with "soundInt is not defined" errors until you switch to a 737. However, once you switch back out of a 737, you won't get the errors. Please ignore these specific console errors, I'm trying to fix it and this addon is also incomplete.

To run this, copy and paste it into the console. Bookmarklet support isn't coming unless requested, as this will eventually be rolled into the realism addon.
