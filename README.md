# Airliner-Sound-Effects-Addon

NOTE: THIS ADDON IS NOT YET COMPLETE. UPDATES ARE COMING RELATIVELY SOON.

This is essentially a "run-and-forget" addon. You run the addon and essentially forget about it, and whenever you are using any 737 or 777 in GeoFS, it will have AriakimTaiyo's custom sound effects (and in the case of the 777, the FBW). It's a wonderful addon, and it'll get more wonderful through the month, as I add alarm and engine sound effects for the A320 family, all the other Boeing aircraft, and even dynamic Concorde sounds.

To run this, copy and paste it into the console. Bookmarklet support isn't coming unless requested, as this will eventually be rolled into the realism addon.
