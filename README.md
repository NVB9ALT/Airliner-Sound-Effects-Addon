# Airliner-Sound-Effects-Addon

This is essentially a "run-and-forget" addon. You run the addon and essentially forget about it, and whenever you are using any 737 or 777 in GeoFS, it will have AriakimTaiyo's custom sound effects, some of which are incredibly immersive.

To run this, copy and paste it into the console. Bookmarklet support isn't coming unless requested, as this is part of the realism addon.
